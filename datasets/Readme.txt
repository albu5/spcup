Training Dataset for Signal Processing (SP) Cup 2016 - Part 1

This training dataset consists of power and audio recordings for a total of nine (9) power grids that are labeled by A to I, respectively.

Recordings are stored in wave files at a sampling rate of 1 kHz (downsampled from the original higher rate with proper anti-aliasing filtering).

In order to facilitate download of manageable file size, we group three grids into one ZIP file. The entire dataset consists of the following ZIP files:

  Training_GridsAtoC.zip
  Training_GridsDtoF.zip
  Training_GridsGtoI.zip
